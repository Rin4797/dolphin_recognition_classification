# Dolphin recognition classifier

This repository contains my third-year coursework, conducted as part of a collaboration with IO RAN. The project was designed to assist IO RAN scientists in studying the dolphin population in the Black Sea. My contribution involved developing a binary classifier to enhance the performance of the baseline model, specifically YOLOv8S.
